<p>It's just a couple of beers with an interesting team. No pressure, zero-commitment, no strings attached.</p>

<p>Our goal is to connect with great developers (and people). We always want you to get the most out of this experience, so there is not a closed agenda or predefined script.</p>

<p>It's a chance for you to learn about what other teams are working on and an opportunity for them to see what you are working on.</p>

<p>Beer not only fuels meaningful conversation, but also gives the opportunity to create long-lasting relationships. We think that's how hiring should be done.</p>

<p>Search through Beercruit Repo an open slot. Meetups are open to anyone, but we want to make them meaningful for both parties. There will be a maximum number of attendees (as well as a minimum) and among all the requests received, we will priortize by request date.</p>

<p>Q: Why free beers?</p>

<p>A: We offer beers because we believe it's a great opportunity to meet talented people in a relaxed environment and is cheaper than joining any recruiting event.</p>

<p>Q: Is it really a free beer session?</p>

<p>A: Yes! We love sharing our project and exchanging ideas with talented people. </p>

<p>Q: What’s in it for you?</p>

<p>A: It’s a chance to sell our company and project to talented professionals, share our challenges and listen what you’re working on over a beer.</p>

<p>Q: Will I have to meet with a recruiter?</p>

<p>A: NO, in fact you will share one of the tech team weekly celebrations.</p>

<p>Q: Is this recruiting?</p>

<p>A: Not explicitly since not everyone is actively job seeking but it’s a wonderful addition to our recruiting initiative. It’s an opportunity to sell our company to the developer community.</p>

<p>Q: Are we going to code?</p>

<p>A: If you want to do so, we will. But we will prefer not, the day is usually long and the beers doesn't help to much to focus.</p>

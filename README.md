# Who says there is no such thing as free beers? 

We are confident business can very well be combined with pleasure. If you’re interested in all things tech and what likeminded people are working on, let’s hang out!

# It's informal, informative and entertaining.
Caravelo is a leader in airline technology creating new services for airlines and passengers worldwide. We're based in Barcelona working hard with cutting edge web technologies. More often than not, we're out and about drinking beer and meeting nice people who are passionate about application development.

We’re interested in meeting you in a relaxed way, with no pressure, zero-commitment or strings attached. No closed agenda, boring monologues just cool work, nice people & potentially great opportunities.

Beer not only fuels meaningful conversation and creativity, but also gives the opportunity to spark true relationships, the kind we really value. 

We’d like to get to know other developers, talk about what different teams are working on while having a good time.  It's a chance for you to learn about what other teams are working on, share experiences and eventually create a spark to work together! 

Are you in the BCN, like programming, beers & networking as they all should be? Come by!

# FAQ
## For Beercruiters
Q: Why free beers?

A: We offer beers because we believe it's a great opportunity to meet talented people in a relaxed environment. It’s also much better money spent than any recruitment event out there.

A: It’s a win-win: a chance to have a genuine exchange of knowledge, maybe unlock valuable work opportunities while having a good time. 

Q: Who will I meet?

A: The entire Caravelo tech team will be there to receive anyone & everyone who’s up for it!

Q: Is this recruiting?

A: Not explicitly since not everyone is actively job seeking but it’s a wonderful opportunity to get to know each other and potentially become coworkers at some point.
 
Q: Are we going to code?

A: We prefer not to and keep the coding out of the bar.

Q: Can anyone join?

A: Yes! If you’re interested in technology, you’re not a jerk & open to meet like-minded people come over!

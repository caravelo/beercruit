# Who says there are no free beers? ![Caravelo's Beercruit 2015](https://img.shields.io/badge/beercruit-Dec--2015-brightgreen.svg)

> Beercruit is a zero-commitment free beer meetup with an amazing team.

# It's just a couple of beers, not recruiting
It's just a couple of beers with an interesting team. No pressure, zero-commitment, no strings attached.

Our goal is to connect with great developers (and people). We always want you to get the most out of this experience, so there is not a closed agenda or predefined script.

It's a chance for you to learn about what other teams are working on and an opportunity for them to see what you are working on.

Beer not only fuels meaningful conversation, but also gives the opportunity to create long-lasting relationships. We think that's how hiring should be done.

# How it works
## 1. Find an open slot
Search through Beercruit repo an open slot. Meetups are open to everyone, but we want to make them meaningful for both parties. There will be a maximum number of attendees (as well as a minimum) and among all the requests received, we will priortize by request date.

## 2. Complete your application

# FAQ
## For Beercruiters
Q: Why free beers?

A: We offer beers because we believe it's a great opportunity to meet talented people in a relaxed environment and is cheaper than joining any recruiting event.

Q: Is it really a free beer session?

A: Yes! We love sharing our project and exchanging ideas with talented people. 

Q: What’s in it for you?

A: It’s a chance to sell our company and project to talented professionals, share our challenges and listen what you’re working on over a beer.

Q: Will I have to meet with a recruiter?

A: NO, in fact you will share one of the tech team weekly celebrations.

Q: Is this recruiting?

A: Not explicitly since not everyone is actively job seeking but it’s a wonderful addition to our recruiting initiative. It’s an opportunity to sell our company to the developer community.

Q: Are we going to code?

A: If you want to do so, we will. But we will prefer not, the day is usually long and the beers doesn't help to much to focus.

## For Other Companies

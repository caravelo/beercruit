Meeting for Beers


# Who says there are no free beers?

## Beercruit is a Zero-Commitment Free Beer meetup with an amazing team.

***


# It's just a couple of beers, not recruiting.
It's just a couple of beers with an interesting team. No pressure, zero-commitment, no strings attached.

Our goal is to connect with great developers (and people). We always want you to get the most out of this experience, so there is not a closed agenda or predefined script.

It's a chance for you to learn about what other teams are working on and an opportunity for them to see what you are working on.

Beer not only fuels meaningful conversation, but also gives the opportunity to create long-lasting relationships. We think that's how hiring should be done.

# How it works
## 1. Find an open slot
Search through Beercruit Repo an open slot. Meetups are open to anyone, but we want to make them meaningful for both parties. There will be a maximum number of attendees (as well as a minimum) and among all the requests received, we will priortize by request date.

## 2. Complete your application
Once you’ve found an open meetup that suits you well, just create a file with the following information:

```
Name Surname: 
Email:
Phone:
Bio tweet:
Why do you want to join?:
Is there any topic you would like to discuss?:
Favorite gif:
```

In other to keep your information private, please encrypt the file using our [private key](../privateKey).
 
## 3. Make a pull request
Once you have it ready, make us a pull request so we can double-check you have enconded the file properly and there is availability for that slot.

## 4. Grab your Beers!
Once approved, we will send you an email with the exact address and bar where we are going to meet. Go and grab your beers! 
Remember: it’s a zero-commitment beer meetup and it's just a chance to share some of the cool things we/you’re working on.
Of course, if we have any opportunities that might be a good fit for you we will let you know ;)

# FAQ
## For Beercruiters
Q: Why free beers?

A: We offer beers because we believe it's a great opportunity to meet talented people in a relaxed environment and is cheaper than joining any recruiting event.

Q: Is it really a free beer session?

A: Yes! We love sharing our project and exchanging ideas with talented people. 

Q: What’s in it for you?

A: It’s a chance to sell our company and project to talented professionals, share our challenges and listen what you’re working on over a beer.

Q: Will I have to meet with a recruiter?

A: NO, in fact you will share one of the tech team weekly celebrations.

Q: Is this recruiting?

A: Not explicitly since not everyone is actively job seeking but it’s a wonderful addition to our recruiting initiative. It’s an opportunity to sell our company to the developer community.

A: If you want to do so, we will. But we will prefer not, the day is usually long and the beers doesn't help to much to focus.

No pressure, zero-commitment, no strings attached.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to connect with great developers (and people). We always want you to get the most out of this experience, so there is not a closed agenda or predefined script.\r\n\r\nIt's a chance for you to learn about what other teams are working on and an opportunity for them to see what you are working on.\r\n\r\nBeer not only fuels meaningful conversation, but also gives the opportunity to create long-lasting relationships. We think that's how hiring should be done.\r\n\r\n# How it works\r\n## 1. Find an open slot\r\nSearch through Beercruit repo an open slot. Meetups are open to everyone, but we want to make them meaningful for both parties. There will be a maximum number of attendees (as well as a minimum) and among all the requests received, we will priortize by request date.\r\n\r\n## 2. Complete your application\r\nOnce you’ve found an open meetup that suits you well, just create a file with the following information:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-------[ Contact Details ]-------\r\n\r\nName:\r\nEmail:\r\nPhone:\r\n\r\n-------[ Favorites ]-------\r\n\r\nBooks:\r\nAuthors:\r\nFilms:\r\nMusic:\r\nI like:\r\nI dislike:\r\n\r\n-------[ Why do you want to join? ]-------\r\n\r\n-------[ Is there any topic you would like to discuss? ]-------\r\n\r\n-------[ Describe your life/slack balance, if applicable ]-------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep your information private, please encrypt the file using our public key and sign it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1\r\n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\r\n9LjslCEn5ZabJyhfhQZ4M3YuNHWu9scxuxY+8cDcoaVULRlN8ubL\r\n=cHL5\r\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Make a pull request\r\nOnce you have it ready, make us a pull request so we can double-check you have enconded the file properly and there is availability for that slot.\r\n\r\n## 4. Grab your Beers!\r\nOnce approved, we will send you an email with the exact address and bar where we are going to meet. Go and grab your beers! \r\nRemember: it’s a zero-commitment beer meetup and it's just a chance to share some of the cool things we/you’re working on.\r\nOf course, if we have any opportunities that might be a good fit for you we will let you know ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n## For Beercruiters\r\nQ: Why free beers?\r\n\r\nA: We offer beers because we believe it's a great opportunity to meet talented people in a relaxed environment and is cheaper than joining any recruiting event.\r\n\r\nQ: Is it really a free beer session?\r\n\r\nA: Yes! We love sharing our project and exchanging ideas with talented people. \r\n\r\nQ: What’s in it for you?\r\n\r\nA: It’s a chance to sell our company and project to talented professionals, share our challenges and listen what you’re working on over a beer.\r\n\r\nQ: Will I have to meet with a recruiter?\r\n\r\nA: NO, in fact you will share one of the tech team weekly celebrations.\r\n\r\nQ: Is this recruiting?\r\n\r\nA: Not explicitly since not everyone is actively job seeking but it’s a wonderful addition to our recruiting initiative. It’s an opportunity to sell our company to the developer community.\r\n\r\nQ: Are we going to code?\r\n\r\nA: If you want to do so, we will. But we will prefer not, the day is usually long and the beers doesn't help to much to focus.\r\n\r\n## For Other Companies\r\nQ: Can I join your meetup?\r\n\r\nA: Yes sure! If you share our point of view and session understanding, we would be happy to also meet you.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAny question?

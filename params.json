We’d love to meet new talent, share experiences in an informal and pleasurable way. \r\n\r\n[![Caravelo's Beercruit 2015](https://img.shields.io/badge/BeerCruit-Nov--2015-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/caravelo/beercruit/tree/master/slots)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Who says there is no such thing as free beers? \r\n\r\nWe are confident business can very well be combined with pleasure. If you’re interested in all things tech and what like-minded people are working on, let’s hang out!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://yukonbeerfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/various-beers.jpg\" height=\"200\">\r\n\r\n\r\n# It's informal, informative and entertaining\r\n[Caravelo](http://www.caravelo.com) is a leader in airline technology creating new services for airlines and passengers worldwide. We're based in Barcelona working hard with cutting edge web technologies. More often than not, we're out and about drinking beer and meeting nice people who are passionate about software development.\r\n\r\nWe’re interested in meeting you in a relaxed way, with no pressure, zero-commitment or strings attached. No closed agenda, boring monologues just cool work, nice people & potentially great opportunities.\r\n\r\nBeer not only fuels meaningful conversation and creativity, but also gives the opportunity to spark true relationships, the kind we really value. \r\n\r\nWe’d like to get to know other developers, talk about what different teams are working on while having a good time.  It's a chance for you to learn about what we're are working on, share experiences and eventually create a spark to work together! \r\n\r\nAre you in the BCN, like programming, beers & networking as it should be?

Make a pull request\r\nOnce you have it ready, make a pull request so we can double-check you have encoded the file properly and there is availability for that slot.\r\n\r\n## 4. Grab your Beers!\r\nOnce approved, we will send you an email with the exact address of the bar where we’re meeting. Being these the firsts meet-ups we’re hosting and hoping we’ll do lots more, we’ll do everything we can to make them as pleasant and interesting as possible!\r\n\r\nRemember: \r\n\r\n> This is a zero-commitment beer meetup and it's just a chance to get to know each other and eventually spark a potential interest to work together!\r\n\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n## For Beercruiters\r\nWhy free beers?\r\n\r\n> We offer beers because we believe it's a great opportunity to meet talented people in a relaxed environment. It’s also money much better spent than any recruitment event out there. \r\n\r\nWhat’s in it for everyone?\r\n\r\n> It’s a win-win: a chance to have a genuine exchange of knowledge, maybe unlock valuable work opportunities while having a good time. \r\n\r\nWho will I meet?\r\n\r\n> The entire Caravelo tech team will be there to receive anyone & everyone who’s up for it!\r\n\r\nIs this recruiting?\r\n\r\n> Not explicitly, since not everyone is actively job seeking but it’s a wonderful opportunity to get to know each other and potentially become coworkers at some point.\r\n \r\nAre we going to code?\r\n\r\n> We prefer not to and keep the coding out of the bar.\r\n\r\nCan anyone join?\r\n\r\n> Yes! If you’re interested in technology, you’re not a jerk & open to meet like-minded people come over!\r\n \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAny other question?
